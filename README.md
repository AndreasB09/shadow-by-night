# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.



Malkavian-related quotes:

"If the most socially functional figure in the city is a Malkavian, then the city is already doomed. But you didn't listen when we told you"

“The Primogen remembers everything.
He simply no longer believes it matters.”

"He already knows what's to come. He simply waits for it"

The Elysium is not 'come be seen', it's 'the city needs witness. THe Elysium is not where you come to celebrate, it's where youre summoned when the city has an announcement. The Harpy doesn't host the party, he rings the bell.

Time has forgotten how to move. This was once a city of stability, a domain others looked to when their own faltered. The nights continue. Titles are honored. Elysiums are held beneath careful light. But something essential has stalled. Authority no longer advances. Decisions are delayed until they no longer matter. Rivalries simmer instead of burn. The Tower remains in control, yet it cannot move forward.

At the heart stands the Prince. The title remains but the throne hangs on a wall. He is present, yet absent. He no longer speaks. He no longer moves. The city has adjusted itself around that stillness. Power has become an exhibition. Revered. Untouchable. Unmovable. A work of art no one dares to question, and no one can compel to act.

The symbol remains. And that is the problem.

The Regent speaks in place of the crown and calls it continuity. Others call it stability and continue their quiet consolidations. Some have already adapted. They remember past upheavals and know how to thrive when institutions rot. Beyond the court, the Movement gathers the restless, and the Thin-Blooded slip through the cracks.

Endless debate has replaced action. Everyone agrees the city endures. No one agrees it survives. And the longer nothing changes, the greater the spark when it does.
